		<h3>Springfield, IL</h3>
		<p>The Lincoln-themed trip was underway.  I landed in St. Louis, grabbed my rental car, and took off for <br> Springfield, IL.  I managed to arrive in time to walk around and snap a couple of pics before it got dark.</p>

		<p>The next day, I got up and took a tour of what was basically the only house Abraham Lincoln ever owned.</p>

		<p>While I could have stayed there all day, there were baseball games to be seen, so I hopped in the car and made my way to Cincinnati.</p>

	  	<h3>Cincinnati, OH</h3>	  
		<p>I was running a little bit behind schedule, so I was worried I might not get to the game on time.  Fortunately, the driving<br> rainstorm that was parked over Cincinnati when I arrived was going to delay the game a bit, so I was thankful for that.</p>

		<p>I stayed for three games and the Mariners won all three, so that made for a really enjoyable trip.  But with the baseball part out of the way, it was time to get back to Lincoln. <br> I turned the car south and headed for Hodgenville, KY, where Lincoln was born.</p>
